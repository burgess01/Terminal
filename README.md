A python program to simulate the basic workings of a terminal

## Introduction

This project implements the basic commands (currently ls, pwd, cd, and exit) into a simple terminal. 
This terminal is able to both take in standard input as well as command line input. 

## What Terminal does

The project is able to grab your local directories, navigate through them and return the values to you in your terminal. 
If a command isn't recognized it will tell you, and if you have a bad command and then use the exit command it will show that the build failed.

## Why Terminal is useful

This project is useful by giving you a basic overview of terminal commands and allowing you to explore the way that an operating system might go about fulfilling these command line input requests at a higher level.

## How users can get started with Terminal

If you want to get started with this project and run it on your own local device, clone it to your computer and run the file either alone or with a standard input file with commands inside of it in order to see the magic happen!
